# **App Name**: DevFolio

## Core Features:

- Hero Section: Display the developer's name, a concise bio, and a call-to-action (e.g., 'View Projects').
- About Me: Showcase the developer's skills with icons and a brief description, alongside a profile picture.
- Projects Section: Grid layout of previous work, with project titles, descriptions, tech stack, and links to live demos or repositories.
- Contact Section: Implement a straightforward contact form and links to social media profiles.
- Responsive Layout: Implement a responsive design for seamless viewing across devices.
- Dark/Light Mode: Include a toggle for switching between dark and light modes, adjusting the color scheme accordingly.
- AI Project Descriptions: AI-Powered Project Description Tool: When the developer adds project details, this tool uses an LLM to suggest compelling project descriptions based on the provided tech stack and project goals, assisting the developer in presenting their work effectively.
- Scroll-Based Animations: Implement scroll-based animations throughout the website using AOS.js or custom JavaScript/CSS. Animate each section as it enters the viewport. Project cards will have subtle hover animations and fade/slide-in effects on scroll. The navigation bar should animate (fade or slide) on scroll direction: hide on scroll down, show on scroll up.
